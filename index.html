        Dazibao (大字报;  Chinese: “big character report”)  proposes a selection of 360 student drawings spanning a decade of GSD option studios taught by George L. Legendre.  Themes include the legacy of High Modernism (“Mies Immersion II,” 2009), form vs. function (“Real and Imaginary Variables: Art Spaces,” 2012), architectural typology (“Block Blob Mat Slab Slat,” 2015) and modes of material production (“Building as Model – Model as Building,” 2018).  The selection is curated in the form of a giant Dazibao, referring to public mural newspapers of the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).
