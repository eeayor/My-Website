# Just Another Website

I have depreciated the Legacy folder, and it now exists as a stand alone repo that you can find [here](https://github.com/logan-lieou/Legacy)

This website is generated using ssg5, which is a POSIX shell script in order to generate the site with no dependencies, except for a markdown converter if you want to write the site in markdown I personaly use lowdown in order to acheive this there is also markdown.pl that can be used. The source code for ssg5 for anyone who is interested can be found [here](https://rgz.ee/bin/ssg5), the color scheme for this site is based off of the linux command line, and all of the css is written by me. In order to use the generate script on your own site for github you would just have to have ssg5 added to your path which you can do pretty easily with `export PATH=[PATH TO SSG5]:"$PATH"` inside of your .bashrc, or .zshrc or whatever shell you're using.
