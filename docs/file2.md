Math is one of the most interesting topics on this page, and I will have a resources list for math, as well as a topics list. I wish I could cover all topics in math, that is unfortuately impossilbe, on top of that I also don't have that much time to go though and write about, explain and give notes for all these diffrent types of maths. So I will only cover some math that I find relevant.

Definitions:

*Arithmetic*
>Baisc maths such as counting, adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, etc.

*Algebra*
>Dealing with symbols and abstractions as unknown numbers and solving for those numbers using arithmetic operations. Algebra also redefines the concept of an equation.

*Logic*
>Dealing with the foundations of math itself

*Discrete Math*
>Dealing with mathematical stuctures which are discrete in nature and not continuious.

*Euclidian Geometry*
>Euclidian Geometry is based in Euclid's postulates which are the fundemental belifs that must be true in order for Euclidian Geometry to be true, Euclidian Geometry therefore only works in Euclidian space, or space that conforms to the postulates of Euclidian Geometry. This is the Geometry most people learn in school.

*Statistics*
>Also known as stats, dealing with data and how we mathematiclly interpret that data.

*Trigonometry*
>Triangles

*Linear Algebra*
>Algebra with matricies and vectors, dealing with linear equations.

*Calculus (Single Var)*
>Limits are the basis of Calculus, single variable calculus essentialy takes the concept of limits and applys them to single variable equations, with the applications of a limit being itegration and diffrentiation.

*Calculus (Multi Var)*
>Calculus with more than one variable.

*Diffrential/Intergal Equations*
>Equations using derivitives and intergrals.

*Non-Euclidian Geometry*
>Geometry with diffrent postulates, this is applicable in space that doesn't conform to Euclid's postulates, examples may include hyperbolic or riemannian geometry.

*Tensor Theory*
>Dealing with tensors, tensors are repersentations of a vector space.

*Set Theory*
>Collections of objects are sets in math these objects can be anything as long as you define them as such, a group of numbers, matricies, tensors, vectors, etc. Set theory deals with mathematical objects as "sets".

*Multilinear Algebra*
>Dealing with multivectors, p-vectors, k-vectors and uses the same methods of linear algebra.

*Game Theory*
>A mathematical theory that fits decision making into a model.
