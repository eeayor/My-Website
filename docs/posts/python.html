<h1 id="Python">Python</h1>

<p>Python is a programming language, it&#39;s probably the easiest language to pick up and learn and understand. From a conceptual standpoint python is probably the best first language as you don&#39;t get overwhelmed by all kinds of extra stuff that&#39;s really not that important for a beginer such as trying to memorize <code>System.out.println();</code> or what the fuck <code>public static void main(String[] args) {</code> does or what the fuck <code>*int</code> means. Python is very strighforeward and easy to understand thus allowing for people to just understand programming, rather than memorizing programming.</p>

<p>A basic hello world: </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello world!")
</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s pretty self explainatory, print out hello world to the screen, that&#39;s it. other concepts are very simple in python as well such as functions.
<code>python
def sum(x, y):
    return x + y
</code></p>

<p>You can see that it&#39;s a function because of the keyword <code>def</code> and you know what it&#39;s returning x + y because of the keyword <code>return</code> you also find that every function needs to return something, or does it? This is where python is kinda bad: </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def hello(name):
    print("Hello " + str(name))
</code></pre>

<p>So someone who is starting out may actually think you are returning something in this function, perhaps a string, but really since types in python are implied this function is a <code>void</code> function meaning that it has no return statement. If a function has no <code>return</code> then it&#39;s void. What we are doing in this function is calling another function then mutating it&#39;s output by passing an arugment.</p>

<p>Something else that&#39;s kinda terrible about programming classes is OOP, and this is something that python does really well as python is considered a <em>multi paradigm</em> language you are not constrained to just OOP like in java or just procedural programming like in C.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
# functional
sum = lambda x y: x + y

# or

sum([x, y])

# oop
class sum_obj:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def call(self):
        return self.x + self.y
        
# most people
def sum(x, y):
    return x + y

</code></pre>

<p>This is really op as it allows people to understand and learn multipule paradigms. Python is also really useful for a number of things, including data science, finance, web development, research (data collection, and math), automation &#47; scripting , and IoT (micropython). You could include game development on there but in all reality py game is a meme and most practical use cases for python in game development fall under automation &#47; scripting.</p>
