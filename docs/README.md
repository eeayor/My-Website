This is some text, there is nothing interesting about me but thanks for comming to my website, so I am now going to bs the rest
of the paragraph just so that I can fill this up with text. So let's talk about this in psychology, in psychology there is a notion in psychology, well that we learned in AP Psychology that there is a critical period for linguistic development this is a theory in linguistics. Okay so the thing is it's just that it's a theory and we act as if this exists but there is no nerological evidence of such a critical period, the notion that this is somehow real or set in stone is based as many things in psychology are on a case study, and having a case study back up your theory makes it a pretty flimsy theory that doesn't apply anywhere except the case study unless you can prove otherwise. So yeah fuck psychology also I just want to say that my website will actually have info here at somepoint but right now it's nothing

This project is an essay on urban morphology, architectural typology, form, and material culture. Taking the historic centre of Quito as a case study, the project seeks to explore the architectural and urban possibilities of the Spanish-American grid in order to increase the variety of living modes in this area of the city as a response to the on-going process of economic activation.

To that end, the project proposes a type of living units not present in the city centre, while embraces the opportunity to challenge the framework of intervention given by the condition of World Heritage Site of the historic core of Quito. A guardian institution in a contemporary building is proposed to set the stage for restoration and preservation of the entire block. The building –an ensemble of artist studios, housing units, domestic shared facilities and exhibition spaces – builds upon the morphology of the Spanish-American block grid at large, and the rules that shape the block also inform the organization of the building. Two new pitched roof houses negotiate the insertion of the project in context and intertwine with a modernist bar that houses residential units and offer the promise of transparency.

This project aims to activate the interior of the block and make it publicly accessible so as to reveal the entire dimension and depth of the block. This new public route on the ground floor uses the sequential layering of the colonial houses – first bay, zaguan, and first and second courtyard- but applies it at the scale of the block. Complementing the activation of the street level, a new datum is created to inhabit the roofscape, framing the mountains and establishing a dialogue with the larger landscape of the city.
