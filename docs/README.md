This is some text, there is nothing interesting about me but thanks for comming to my website, so I am now going to bs the rest
of the paragraph just so that I can fill this up with text. So let's talk about this in psychology, in psychology there is a notion in psychology, well that we learned in AP Psychology that there is a critical period for linguistic development this is a theory in linguistics. Okay so the thing is it's just that it's a theory and we act as if this exists but there is no nerological evidence of such a critical period, the notion that this is somehow real or set in stone is based as many things in psychology are on a case study, and having a case study back up your theory makes it a pretty flimsy theory that doesn't apply anywhere except the case study unless you can prove otherwise.


    >grammar-learning ability remains strong until age 17 or 18, at which point it drops. The findings suggest that the critical 
    period for learning language is much longer than cognitive scientists had previously thought.
