# Tensors

## Vectors

So to start with you may want to go with vectors. Vectors are the way to go when learning about tensors, because a vector is a tensor of rank 1. There is only 1 basis vector per component in a rank 1 tensor. So we have the basis vectors which are the vectors of value 1 that repersent the directions of the vector, for some vector p we can say it moves 2 i-hat unit vectors in the x-direction and 3 j-hat unit vectors in the y-dirction. We can then repersent the vector with the numbers [2,3] which indicate the direction of the vector components. number of numbers in a tensor = number of dim ^ rank of tensor. A tensor of rank 2 in 3d space has 9 numbers. A general way to repersent a rank 2 tensor is in a matrix with 9 numbers [Axx, Ayx, Axz, Ayx, Ayy, Ayz, Azx, Azy, Azz]. So one of these vectors may repersent is a force vector x which has an area in the x direction. A force in the y direction on an area in the x direction may also occur.

## Rank 3 Tensor

27 components, pretain to one of 27 sets of 3 basis vectors, the rank it seems refers to the number of basis vectors.

## Why we use Tensors

All observers in all reference frames agree on the combonation of all of the components and basis vectors, the combonation of all components and basis vectors, is a tensor. The basis vectors transform one way thorugh reference frames, and components transfer another way in which keeps the combonation of all of these the same for all observers.
