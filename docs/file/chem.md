Dealing with the interactions of very small things noteably atoms, and molec.

## General Chemistry

### Stoichiometry

Stoichiometry is Dimensional Analysis dealing with chemistry, the most important unit here is the mol. which is 6.02 * 10^23 atoms, when given a chemical reaction you can convert units using *Dimensional Analysis* which is:

 if you want to find the mass of a percipitate you can find this using Stoich, for example given something like AgNO3 + NaCl -> AgCl + NaNO3 this reaction is 1 to 1 because for each mol of AgNO3 or NaCl 1 mol of AgCl is produced or 1 mol of NaNO3, that statement is actually bad so it's more like 1 mol of AgNO3 and NaCl each goes to make 1 mol of AgCl and NaNO3. If the reaction is not 1 to 1 you have to convert using diffrent values for the number of mols. mols are defined by the coef of the componds. *Molar Mass* is the mass of an element on the periodic table in grams per mol.

### Conservation of Energy

Energy is conserved in a reaction always because of the first law of thermodynamics, given some sum of initial energies the sum of the final energies should equal the initial energy for example K_init + U_init = K_final + U_final + q if U_final + K_final don't equal K_init + U_init then we can assume that the missing energy was probably lost to friction or heat, which equals the term q.
