What are all these topics, most of them are pretty self explainitory, but I'll quickly define these topics broadly.

*Economics*
> The study of markets.


*Psychology*
> The study of how people think.


*History*
> The study of the past.

*Political Science*
> The study of government.

*Linguistics*
> The study of language.

*Sociology*
